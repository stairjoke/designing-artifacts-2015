			<h1>My Gap - refinement week 2</h1>
			<p>An artifact constructed from detachable modules that allows to recharge electronic devices in a stylish appearance, replenishes itâ€™s power source on its own, is secure and can be located remotely.</p>
			<h1>My Gap</h1>
			<h2>A nice electronics bag with solar panels to charge whatever you put into it.</h2>
			<blockquote>I wish my bag charged my phone, tablet, camera, headphones, watch&hellip;</blockquote>
			<p>A purse/murse/rucksack/bag that looks great, protects it's contents against bumps and falls and has an internal battery and solar panels so all my devices stay charged when they're inside.</p>

			<p>I imagine it as a single strap bag, inspired by designs like the one above but big enough to hold a small notebook or an iPad. A solar panel in the closing flap and a fairly large battery integrated into a side or the back, strong enough to charge multiple devices.</p>
			<h2>Why this gap meets the course project criteria</h2>
			<p>
				Often when I travel or just work outside I encounter an empty battery. It affects how I use my devices, so this gap is a regular frustration for me. A bag that incorporates a solar panel and a battery to charge devices can close this gap. Of course I share this problem with many people and given my skills I believe I can build a prototype within eight weeks, because I know electronics well enough to build this myself and I learned to sew leather.
