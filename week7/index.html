			<h1>Coursera design course â€” Week 7 Assignment</h1>
			<p>
				Last week I had discovered I might have to use a simpler project for this weeks assignment but I decided to push on and get as far as I could. Here is a list of changes that I made from alpha to beta prototype:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Shape.</strong> The original idea was a cast aluminium cylinder with ridges. First I removed the ridges and made a smooth surface, then I decided on an oval to make replacing and charging the batteries outside the device simpler.</li>
				<li><strong>Materials.</strong> Aluminium insulates EM waves and would significantly hinder phones inside the cylinder from communicating. This would waste energy. Replacing the aluminium with a sturdy yet not electrically conducting material I decided on a plastic that is used in construction work from time to time.</li>
				<li><strong>Function.</strong> Back to the basics, the artifact now holds devices inside and can be used to charge them via USB. The batteries in it can either be replenished on a bike, in a car, a scooter, motorcycle etc. The new electronics can handle input from 6V to 18V. Connecting the device remains an unsolved problem for the time being.</li>
				<li><strong>Lid.</strong> The closing mechanism has been replaced with four ultra strong magnets that can hold the lid in place. It still can easily be removed by simply pressing it away sideways.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Opening the artifact reveals the inside space as well as the battery slots. It takes six rechargeable AA batteries that are easily user replaceable and can be charged at home as well as underway. The artifact functions with and without those batteries and can be used as a USB power adapter on a bike, scooter, motorcycle or in a car.<br />
				Containing six AA batteries gives it a potential storage capacity of about 16700mAh or more.

			<h3>The state of the beta prototype</h3>
			<p>
				I have decided to name it:
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 2em; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">JuiceCan</p>
			<h3>Refinements</h3>
			<p>
				As described above, the second prototype (alpha, last week) revealed a number of <strike>flaws</strike> design challenges. This new prototype incorporates:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A shape that doesn't roll away when it falls down.</li>
				<li>The materials used do not interfere with cellphone reception.</li>
				<li>The materials are lighter.</li>
				<li>It floats!</li>
				<li>The lid is easier to open and close.</li>
				<li>It no longer endangers other things inside a bag, because its built from softer materials.</li>
				<li>It flexes slightly and thus can buffer some of the impact if dropped.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>

				The second picture was taken a day later, after I had hidden the red and white wires, they are now in a different place. The picture shows my iPhone charging, the JuiceCan is hooked up to a battery via that blue thing.
			</p>
			<p>
				It turned out surprisingly light and the plastic is sturdy. The red and white cables attach to the dynamo, the USB connector can be used for charging.
			</p>
			<h3>The gap and JuiceCan</h3>
			<p>
				My original gap was "In what way might we decrease 'battery-anxiety' when there is no power available to recharge." The JuiceCan connects to a bike, scooter, motorcycle or car and carries it's own batteries. It allows to recharge devices without an external power source for a limited time. Additionally it protects small devices like phones that you can store inside and it is very light and fits easily into other bags etc.

			<p>
				All in all this week encouraged me to explore this idea and others, maybe revisit the initial idea of my bag. This course helped me acquire new skills and a new way of approaching problems in my every day life.
