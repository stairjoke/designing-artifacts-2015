			<h1>Coursera design course — Week 2 Assignments</h1>
			<h2>2.1 Design problem definition</h2>
			<p><strong>Original:</strong> I want to create a solar powered bag that recharges my electronic devices.<br />
				<strong>Derived problem statement:</strong> In what way might I increase a device's battery life when I travel?</p>
			<p>The question "Why would I want to do that?" was asked starting with the derived problem statement to arrive at list items 4 to 1 to generalize the problem statement. The answer with the number four was selected to focus on specifics using the question "How might I do that?". Answers five through nine increase complexity and show two possible paths to solve the problem, clearly diverging already at five.</p>
			<p><strong>Note.</strong> I was very tempted to go for number three instead, but given the timeframe of eight weeks, its too broad and general a topic to design a single solution for on my own.</p>
			
			<h3>The „Why would I want to do that?“-List from most general to most specific</h3>
			
			<ol>
			<li>To decrease stress and increase the joy of life.</li>
			<li>To increase productivity and allow for more creative ideas underway.</li>
			<li>To help people have more free time at home and allow them to explore new ideas underway.</li>
			<li><img src="star.gif" alt="Selected" class="icon" /><strong>To decrease “battery-anxiety” when there is no power available to recharge.</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>"How might I do that?" focus question</h3>
			<ol start="5" class="start5"> <!-- why would you make a content thing a CSS thing? -->
			<li>By decreasing power consumption and increasing power supply. With a set of best practices and a mobile charging unit that replenishes itself.</li>
			<li>By researching and testing possibilities to use devices more efficiently and with a mobile solar panel and a battery from which to recharge the devices.</li>
			<li>By identifying the most power hungry tasks and applications and by building the solar panel and battery into something we carry with us all the time.</li>
			<li>Through surveys based on preliminary research and experience and by replacing some of the surfaces of a carrying artifact for electronics with a flexible solar panel.</li>
			<li>(a) By collecting available information online and<br />
			(b) by identifying the most convenient artifact to carry devices in.<br />
			(a) By distilling this information into statements and questions for surveys and by<br />
			(b) identifying the most effective and also protected surfaces of that carrying artifact.<br />
			(a) By creating those surveys using a free online platform and posting links to those surveys in the class forums and sending them out to friends and family.<br />
			(b) By trying different shapes of carrying artifact (bag, rucksack, purse/muse) and using them in everyday environments and paying close attention where they bump into people and objects and which surfaces get wet when it rains or dirty when it’s on the floor or in a compartment like in airplanes.</li>
			</ol>
