			<h1>Coursera design course â€” Week 6 Assignments</h1>
			<p>As I should have expected, building a real physical prototype proofed to be challenging. My digital prototype (<a href="../week5/">you can find the renderings on last week's page</a>) was very helpful from several perspectives. I was able tu build a crude but effective prototype this week that had the shape and dimensions of my digital prototype, it was of course not yet a cast aluminium cylinder with custom rubber lids, but it was a cylinder with a USB port for charging and a connection to hook it up to a dynamo:</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				You can see the USB port to plug in any USB chargeable device and the two wires, here with a small socket, that connect to the dynamo or in this case I added the socket so I could simulate the bike as a power source indoors for testing. To test run it on a bike those two wires are attached, usually with small clamps, to the dynamo and the bike-frame.
			</p>
			<h2>What I learned from this prototype / Refinements</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>For some this solution would be exactly right, but sadly for many the can is too bulky and heavy (given the weight of the batteries inside).<br />
				<em>The can needs to be smaller and lighter.</em></li>
				<li>Production of high fidelity prototypes (such as a proper alpha and later on a beta prototype) will require me to hire professional help. Making a cast aluminium cylinder of this size and properly fitting electronics isn't that difficult, however<br />
				<em>I will have to drop the ridges (<a href="../week5/">see renderings lasst week</a>) and go with a smooth cylinder.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Whats next?</h2>
			<p>
				All in all I am committed to a clear direction that may require me to replace my gap for the last week of this project with a design problem I was addressing in parallel to this course at work. I know exactly where I want to go with this product from here, but its simply too big a project for the one week left to build prototypes in this course.
			</p>
			<p>
				In parallel to this course I was working on a website for a small business that is currently in the stage of first prototype for mobile. I believe given the time-frame I will shelve <a href="../mygap/">my current gap</a> and post a summary of me addressing the other one alongside my beta prototype next week.
			</p>
			<h2>Summary of week 6</h2>
			<p>
				Checking against the criteria for this week's evaluation, I noticed that despite everything its actually quite good:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>I am committed to this design direction.</strong><br />
				Award 2 points if the student committed to a design direction (award only 1 if it was unclear)</li>
				<li><strong>Half done.</strong><br />
				Award an additional 2 points if the student built a representative prototype that a user could try (award only 1 if it was unclear)</li>
				<li><strong>It uncovered refinements.</strong><br />
				Award an additional 3 points if the prototype is able to uncover refinements that need to be made for the beta/final prototype</li>
				<li><strong>Not so great.</strong><br />
				Award an additional 1 - 3 points based on the quality of the prototype (i.e., how well it conveys the design intent and how well it was crafted)</li>
			</ul>
