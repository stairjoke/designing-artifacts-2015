			<h2>5.1 Concept Testing - 1 Concept</h2>
			<h3>1) Concept refinments</h3>
			<p>
				Last week I had started to go into more detail on the saddle-bag. (<a href="../week4/">See last week&hellip;</a>) This week our assignment was to select one concept using feedback, I decided I would merge some of the functionality of two concepts, the saddle-bag and the normal bag.
			</p>
			<p>
				To combine the mobility of the normal bag with integrated battery and charging ports with biking, I decided the saddle bag should be easy to detach, so it could be put into a bag and used to charge when you're away from the bike. Here is a cross section of the artifct I came up with , the JuiceCan. Its roughly as big as a medium sized water bottle, the exterior is aluminium and rubber. The water tight seal can be screwed off to reveal a coloured foam that holds your phone etc. in place when you use it biking. Inside is a USB-port a huge cylindrical battery and at the very end the electronics to regulate the electricity. the USB-port is two way and can also be used to charge the JuiceCan.
			</p>

				For the survey I did some renderings, here they are in high resolution:

			</p>
			<h3>2) Concept test</h3>
			<p>
				To test the concept I decided to create a purchase intent survey, the results were mixed and I love that some of the responses contained valuable feedback! So here are three of them:
