			<h2>3.1 Exploration - 10 concepts</h2>
			<p>
				It took me quite a few approaches to find the right way to decompose this:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				In what way might we decrease “battery-anxiety” when there is no power available to recharge.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Eventually I decomposed it into user actions/steps:<br />
				<strong>You charge your device then enter the cycle of storing it, and using it repeatedly until you end up with an empty battery.</strong><br />
				I decided to take the time that was storing and use it to charge the battery, the two decomposed questions I then asked were:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the ways we store devices?</li>
				<li>What are the ways we might charge devices?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Here are some ideas:</h3>

			</p>
			<p>
				And following are the 10 concepts I came up with. I have a favorite, the bag, so it was especially difficult to think outside that box&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">A</span> A battery pack with a solar panel to keep the charge up longer.<br /><br />

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">B</span> A concept that utilizes the wasted energy of a hamster wheel to charge your phone etc.<br /><br />
				<img src="02-hamster-wheel-power.jpg" alt="A concept that utilizes the wasted energy of a hamster wheel to charge your phone etc." />
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">C</span> A way to charge your phone and other devices using the power generated by the dynamo of your bike.<br /><br />

			<p>
				<span class="list-style">D</span> A regular dock and a charger.<br /><br />

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">E</span> A leather sleeve letter sized with a solar panel on the outside, a battery inside and a pocket for your phone.<br /><br />

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">F</span> Simply attach this to your bike's handle bar and plug your phone into the wind power.<br /><br />

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">G</span> An unconventional chair, it creates electricity from the movements you make and charges your phone with it.<br /><br />

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">H</span> My favorite (see gap site for more). A bag with a solar panel on the lid and a battery in the bottom. You can open it all the way to use it as a notebook stand while it's recharging through it's solar panels.<br /><br />

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="list-style">I</span> A battery pack that generates power from being shook up and down while walking for example.<br /><br />

				<span class="list-style">J</span> My second favorite concept: A clip on solar panel that simply has a USB outlet to plug anything into it that fits inside your pocket!<br /><br />

			<blockquote>
				Sketch of a chair correctly in 2 point perspective (three quarter view)
